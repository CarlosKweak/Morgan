# Morgan

A travel companion for your apps, a solitaire friend for [Walker](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Walker). This library aims to make the job of using day to day animations easier, just with one line of code you are going to be able to do delightful animations.

Note that **Morgan** is never finished, as I find more and more cases and animations in my daily iOS life, I'll keep adding them here, making the biggest set of animations in iOS, and you can help on that to.

## Code

**Morgan** uses [Walker](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Walker) as the animation engine and works tight with him to provide you with a set of different animations, let me show you a few of them.

To check the rest of them, check the [source file](www.apple.com).

## Upcoming features

As stated above, Morgan is always in motion, always changing, growing and improving, there's no roadmap, just a set of new PR every time I, or someone else finds something interesting to share with the community.
